COCOMO
	Constructive cost model
	data collected from 63 software projects
		actual LoC
		actual effort
		actual schedule duration

regression analysis was used to develop equations that best describe the data
	a statistical technique used to find relationships between variables for predictinv values

(basic) CoCoMo overview
	3 modes(project types)
		organic, semi-detached, embedded
	3 levels of analysis (varies in accuracy)
		basic, intermediate, detailed
idea
	estimate effort
	estimate development time
	estimate staffing needs
	estimate productivity

Modes
	Organic mode
		smaller team sizes, familiar with enviornment, little innovation, few constraints and deadlines
	Semi-Detached
		a mix of experienced and inexperienced team members
	Embedded mode
		a complex system, diverse nature of projects (air traffic, weapon systems)

Basic Analysis
	Effort
		E = a * size^b
	Estimate development time
		TDEV = c * E^d
