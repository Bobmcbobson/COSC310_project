Types of people
	one person may just think of courses, prereqs and job implications
		think about alternatives after

User story
	short description of a feature
	written in a client's language
		easy for them to understand
	should provide only enough detail to make a low-risk estimate of how long it would take to implement

role-goal-value form
	as a <role>
	I can <activity>
	for <business thing>

	ex
		as an instructor I need to log in to connect in order to post student marks
		as a gmail user I can select and highlight a conversation for further action
		as a  user I can backup selected folers so the backup drive isn't filled with junk

Traditional vs agile requirements
	"The system shall..."
	does not give rational or context for the requirements

Writing stories
	should get the client to do this
	smaller is better, easier to write and test
