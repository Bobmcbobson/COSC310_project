Scope, schedule and cost determain quality

Importance of project management
	people won't use something if people don't use it
If the scope is too large the project team wont' beable to meet expectations

If the cost is too high, project may be cancelled

To succeed
	Need good planning and organization
	appropriate life cycle, suitable team

What makes a good manager?
	Somebody who knows what their team is doing
	Lets his people be creative
	Should push his team members while being respectful

If the PM does not help you...
	Might get stuck, nobody to turn to
	Might make the wrong assumptions, no way of knowing if the PM isn't there to help
	Not much feedback

If the PM is too involved...
	Might get under my skin
	Does not seem to trust me

Competencies for a PM
	Product compitencies, project competencies, people competencies
	Basically, not all technical stuff

If a PM has no project competency
	waste money, waste time

If a PM has no people competency
	could stress people out, making them less productive

Main responsibilities
	Project planning
		Formal project creation
	result of a planning exercise is the creation of documents
		Industry chart, statement of work
			what the project is
		academia: project proposal, project plan
			how the project will be carrid out
		both include why the project is needed

Project Sizing
	Prediction of hte amount of code needed to fulfill requirements
	estimate size of software
	size could be measured in...
		lines of code
		function points
		feature points
		number of processes in a data flow diabram
		number of objects, attributes, services in an object oriented diabram

Project Estimation: prediction of the resources that are needed for a project
	estimated in terms of effort, not dollars
	considers
		calendar time
		staffing availability, capability, productivity
			some people are better at working than others
		budget constraints
			don't see much of this as a programmer
		creeping requirements
			scope might change, probably increase
		what if- analysis
			ie: what if an employee is sick or switch to a new project

Project scheduling
	reflects all of the relationships amoung resources and activities of a project
		mapped to a calendar
		includes truly productive working hours
			most places we work 8 hours per day
				consider 5 of these hours productive, hard to work 8 hours straight
		a best guess of hte future
	ways to represent a schedule
		simple table
		Gantt chart (will see this later)
		pert diagrams (more for schedule issues)
	Indicates dates of major milestones
		put those major dates into the schedule
	Compares estimates vs actuals
		start with an estimate, update it with actual time as you go

Project monitoring
	management of scope, schedule, cost, quality
	change control process
	metrics = measurement of an observable unit (lines of code, hours worked)
		want to know why an employee is working at a faster or slower pace than others or usual
		establish baselines
	progress management
		want to make sure a project is going well a few days, weeks and months into the project
			(earned value management)
	risk management
		making sure different aspects of risks are covered
			how likely people are to leave or resources will be used up
		Can try to find countermeasures to deal with these risks

Project quality control
	defects should be highlighed and brought to surface for corrective action
		DO NOT hide this, bugs are not shameful, must figure out how to fix this
	Improved quality saves money and improves business value
		feel good about accomplishing more
	Quality assurance
		Get people to try to break your stuff
		have kids come in and do crazy things to break your stuff, they are good at it

Communication in Meetings
	basic objectives of meetings
		information exchange
			found something
		problem solving
		decision making
			may need to cut features
		planning
			which parts of the system to build first
		evaluation
			perhaps eachother, other employees
	meeting roles
		Somebody calls the meeting (called the client, not necessarily the actual client)
		participants, scribe(takes notes), facilitator/coach(directs the meeting)
	meeting input
		agenda
			what you are going to talk about
		specify: attendies, plan/schedule, resources
	meeting output
		minutes (include in the weekly reports!)
		specify decisions, outcomes, action items

Handling meetings
	meeting rules
		agenda published before meeting
			like to know why we are going, caller sets it up
		must have output
		output must be published to common project space
			need to keep this somewhere everyone can see it
	negotiation
		not the same as bargaining--want a win-win situation
		skills are very important for any manager
	Conflict resolution
		recognition and support of individual differences

Project reporting
	could be daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly
		determined in the project plan
			more intensive projects may require more detailed reports
			possibly at the end of a phase or end of a major milestone
	Normally includes
		scope
		accomplishments
		critical incidents and mitigation
			lost employees
		plans (schedule, cost, estimates vs actuals)
	visual representation
		simpler, faster grasp information (if used properly)

Agile project management
	adopts an emperical approach
		do not want to do too much planning
		basically take data from the project to do estimates for the project
