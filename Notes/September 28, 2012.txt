The result of a project plan is the creation of a document
	A charter, statement of work
		what the project is
	Academia: project proposal and/or project plan
		how it will be carried out
	also some justificaton for both

	plan = WBS + Staffing + cost + schedule

Why bother with a project plan?
	who will read it?
		I will
		my prof (in academia)
		client
	when might it be useful?
		when a new team member comes in
		if you forget something
		gives you direction at the beginning of the project
		at the end - to make sure things were not missed
	Is it worth it?
		Decide for yourself
			must come up with a plan for this course in A2

Creating a project plan
	Decompose the project into WBS
	Assign hardware to human resources
		multiple people may require the same hardware which can't be shared
	estimate schedule required
	budget estimation
don't plan in secret

plans should be reviewed and approved by people who carry them out

Project plan as a benchmark
	provides a high level view of
		project objectives
		major work activities
		deliveralbes
		milestones
			events that happen (ex: prototype 1 is done)
		required resources
		schedule
		budget
becoms the benchmark for controlling the project execution
	most important part of the document

Project plans in agile models?
	what is the equivalent of a project plan in XP?
		There isn't one!  We plan minimally
	what can we do to back-engineer a project plan? (what purpose does it serve?)
		Sometimes it is asked to do this


Work product vs deliverables
	work product
		anything tangible produced by the project
		might not give it all to the client
	deliverables
		give these to the client

types of WBS
	product view
		depicts hierarchical relationship between software modules
	process view
		depicts hierarchical relationship between work activities
		listening to steps that need to be done
	both are necessary and need to be considered in sizing and estimation
