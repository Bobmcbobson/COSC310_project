Managing People:
	need to manage people who work individually
	"People are an organization's most important asset"

	Some issues in personnel management
		Respecting your staff -- can be harder than you think
		Selecting staff -- Might seem like a good candidate but it doesn't work out for many reasons
		Motivation -- Enviornment might not promote it, might do less and less work if you are less motivated
		Group management

People management factors
	Remeber these issus
		consistency
			Treat everyone in a team equally, don't favour your friends
			ie.  If you know 2 programmers out of 10 work at home, could be due to favouritism, might feel discriminated against
		Respect
			Different people have different skills and experiences, just because they don't work as fast on something doesn't mean they are not as good
		Inclusion
			Involve all members
			Ensure all views are considered
			can be hard if new people come in
		Honesty
			Be honest about what is going on
			Don't just try hard not to hurt peoples' feelings, let them know what they are doing wrong
			Don't necessarily be too critical
		Diplomacy
			Be careful in discussionsto be honest, positive supportive

Staff selection

		relatively small percent of those hired are responsible for the best and worst performances
