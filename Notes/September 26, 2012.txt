Case tools
	Case Computer Aided Software Engineering
		engineering discipline to software development


Why use CASE tools?
	reuction of effort
	quicker development
	reduction of defects
		software fixes this
	easier identification of defects
	increased reuse
		don't have to recode things
	increased standardization

Classification by Task Type...

Information engineering tools
	provide models to derive specific information systems
		not necessarily technology systems
		could go into a restaurant with no tech at all, their info system is transfer of money etc.
	Information system: A system that defines the interaction between people, processes and data (information)
	Models
		business objects
		their relationships, one object to another
		how objects might flow between different business areas within a company

Project planning tools
	project templates
	size estimation
	cost estimation
	planning(decomposing tasks, depicting relationships)
	scheduling (across multiple projects)
	progress monitoring
	projections

Risk analysis tools
	help identify...
		list of potential risks
		events causing these risks
		probability of occurence of each event
		diagramming the dependencies of risks
		calculating risk
		triggers for risks
		monitoring risks (if ongoing)
		documented plan for mitigating specific tasks
