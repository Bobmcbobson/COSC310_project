A community leader would fill out the inital page
	city table in the database

Possibly have a main image for all cities
	perhaps add small things for different cities
	would be hard to make look good

Mobile is key for Rural communities

Possibly take more info
	too much is not good though
	might be bad to add the wrong info
smaller icons

might be crowded if they add everything
	don't necessarily need to be pretty

Database
	Thinking of having a table of cities, entered by community leader
	table of users with randomly generated id and info
	user selection, tied to the user table
	image selections in binary
		sounds good to Wayne

Wayne says we are using a Huroku server
	not starting with lots of data
	free
	good launching pad

The "Fun" stuff
	how does the data interact with eachother?
		combining the design and vision box
		look at see how many people have selected each option

options can be tied to many visions and vice-versa

for recommendations
	show them what they picked, the aggregate and the recommendation
	based on personalities

expected utility

build a system where it's easy to change the numbers
	how options apply to visions

possibly limit the number of options they choose
	perhaps a flat number or cost for each one and a total budget

set up huroko server
look at algorithm and utility functions

we need images!
